This song is an epic tale of an old man forever sailing the seas waiting for the wave that will finally wash him overboard to join his wife in in the great beyond. As one of the first song that Eric ever wrote, it has evolved through many versions to become what it is today. As a group, The Nest decided to bring it a more rock feel while still maintaining its folky elements.

With criss-crossing 3 part harmonies that define a what we consider to be core to the our style, the song enjoys a unique thickness. Listen in the 2nd verse, after the lyrics "the waves roll o'er the deck" and you will hear Fred turn up the spring reverb on his amp, and literally kick it, to create a subtle sensation of a rolling surf.
