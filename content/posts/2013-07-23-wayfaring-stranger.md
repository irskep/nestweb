Wayfaring Stranger is an old spiritual, known and covered by hundreds of artists about a lost soul wandering through life searching for salvation. The Nest plays this song hearkening back to country roots through the verses and choruses but adds hard-rocking instrumental breaks resulting in a more forward driving song with cross-genre flare. The sometimes dissonant harmonies and non-traditional vocal lines add that modern touch to a true classic.
