As one of the first song that Eric ever wrote, it has evolved through many versions to become what it is today. As a group, The Nest decided to bring it a more rock feel while still maintaining its folky&amp;nbsp;elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With criss-crossing 3 part harmonies that define a what we consider to be core to the our style, the song enjoys a unique thickness. Listen in the 2nd verse, after the lyrics &amp;#8220;the waves roll o&amp;#8217;er the deck&amp;#8221; and you will hear Fred turn up the spring reverb on his amp, and literally kick it, to create a subtle sensation of a rolling&amp;nbsp;surf.&lt;/p&gt;

Written by Genny, this song takes off with a driving funky bass line and syncopated mandolin adding a uniquely reggae twist. Even the structure of the song is to be taken with a a grain of salt switching between minor and major keys. This song does have have a chorus, so the music is most engaging through the transitions. Listen to the inter-weaving mandolin and guitar lead lines, the subtle harmonies, and the bass solo at the end. Not to mention Genny&amp;#8217;s powerful vocal&amp;nbsp;performance.&lt;/p&gt;

The Nest plays this song hearkening back to country roots through the verses and choruses but adds hard-rocking instrumental breaks resulting in a more forward driving song with cross-genre flare. The sometimes dissonant harmonies and non-traditional vocal lines add that modern touch to a true&amp;nbsp;classic.&lt;/p&gt;
